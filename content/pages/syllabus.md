Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course is offered as part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA), and will be delivered at MIT (by MIT faculty) for MIT students and simultaneously broadcast to the National University of Singapore (NUS) for SMA students. In some cases the roles will reverse: the classes will be delivered at NUS (by NUS SMA faculty) and simultaneously broadcast to MIT.

MIT Units: 3-0-9, Graduate H-level Credit
-----------------------------------------

A presentation of the fundamentals of modern numerical techniques for a wide range of linear and nonlinear elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations and integral equations central to a wide variety of applications in science, engineering, and other fields. Topics include: mathematical formulations, finite difference and finite volume discretizations, finite element discretizations, boundary element discretizations, direct and iterative solution methods.

Prerequisites
-------------

MIT: 18.03 or 18.06 or equivalent; and familiarity with MATLAB{{< sup "Â®" >}}.

Instructors
-----------

Prof. Jaime Peraire  
Prof. Anthony T. Patera  
Prof. Jacob White  
Prof. Boo Cheong Khoo
